The solution begins with migrating Contoso's SQL Server 2008 R2 database to Azure SQL Database using the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS). Using the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) assessment, Contoso determined that they can migrate into a fully-managed SQL database service in Azure. The assessment revealed no compatibility issues or unsupported features that would prevent them from using Azure SQL Database. Next, they deploy the web and API apps into Azure App Services. Also, mobile apps, built for Android and iOS using Xamarin, are created to provide remote access to PolicyConnect. The website, hosted in a Web App, provides the user interface for browser-based clients, whereas the Xamarin Forms-based app provides the UI for mobile devices. Both the mobile app and website rely on web services hosted in a Function App. An API App is also deployed to host APIs for the legacy Windows Forms desktop application. Light-weight, serverless APIs are provided by Azure Functions and Azure Functions Proxies to give access to the database and policy documents stored in Blob Storage.

Sensitive configuration data, like connection strings, are stored in Key Vault and accessed from the APIs or Web App on demand so that these settings never live in their file system. A full-text cognitive search pipeline is used to index policy documents in Blob Storage. Cognitive Services are used to enable search index enrichment using cognitive skills in Azure Search. PowerApps is used to enable authorized business users to build mobile and web create, read, update, delete (CRUD) applications. These apps interact with SQL Database and Azure Storage. Microsoft Flow enables them to orchestrations between services such as Office 365 email and services for sending mobile notifications. These orchestrations can be used independently of PowerApps or invoked by PowerApps to provide additional logic. The solution uses user and application identities maintained in Azure AD.
